### Problem 1: Modify the Binary Search Algorithm to Search for an Item in an Array of Strings


#### Task:
1. Implement a binary search algorithm that can search for a given string in a sorted array of strings.
2. The function should return the index of the string if it is found, and -1 if it is not found.

#### Requirements:
- The input array must be sorted in ascending order.
- The search should be case-insensitive.


### Problem 2: Product Class and Operations

#### Description:
In this task, you will create a `Product` class and perform various operations on a list of `Product` objects.

#### Task:
1. Create a `Product` class with the following attributes:
    - `id` (int)
    - `name` (String)
    - `price` (double)
2. Create a list of `Product` objects.
3. Implement a method to find products within a given price range using streams and the `filter` method.
4. Implement a method to increase the price of each product by 10% using streams and the `map` method.
5. Implement sorting for the list of products by `id`, `name`, and `price`.


#### Example:
- Create a list of `Product` objects with various `id`, `name`, and `price` values.
- Find all products within the price range of `100` to `500`.
- Increase the price of each product by `10%`.
- Sort the list of products by `id`, `name`, and `price` and display the sorted lists.
